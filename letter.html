      <p class="letter">
        On this special day, I find myself searching for words to express what my heart has known all along—words that can only barely contain the depth of what you mean to me. 💌<br><br>

        If I were to compare you to the stars, you wouldn’t just be one—no, you would be the entire constellation, lighting up the darkest skies, making everything around you shimmer with magic and wonder. You have that incredible ability to make even the ordinary feel extraordinary, and the way you touch the world is nothing short of breathtaking. ✨<br><br>

        In this vast universe, we are but two specks of dust, yet somehow, our paths crossed. I once thought of the ocean as endless and mysterious, but after meeting you, I’ve come to realize that the true depths of the sea are only a shadow of the depths of my love for you. 🌊❤️<br><br>

        When I see you smile, it’s as if the whole world pauses, just for a moment, to witness the beauty of that very moment. It’s a melody that plays in my heart, an eternal song that never fades, a reminder of why I am so fortunate to share my life with you. You are the harmony that makes the symphony of my life complete. 🎶<br><br>

        In the garden of life, you are the rarest bloom, a flower so delicate and so full of life that even the winds of time cannot diminish your grace. 🌸 You make me believe in things I never thought possible—in love that transcends distance, time, and space. It’s as if our hearts were woven together long before we even met, and each moment with you feels like an unraveling of a beautiful, endless story. 💫<br><br>

        Every time I hear your voice, it’s as if the world finds its rhythm again. Every laugh, every word, every glance—it’s all so meaningful. My love for you is not just in the grand gestures, but in the quiet moments we share, in the way our hands fit together as if they were always meant to be. 🤝<br><br>

        And so, on this special day, I want to wish you more than just a Happy Birthday—I want to wish you a lifetime of happiness, love, and all the dreams your heart holds. I want to remind you, every day, that you are loved beyond measure, that the world is a better place because you are in it, and that you mean more to me than words could ever say. 💫❤️<br><br>

        I love you more than the stars, more than the oceans, more than anything this world could ever offer. You are my everything. 🫀<br><br>

        With all my love,  
        Shravan 💌
